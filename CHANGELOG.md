v1.1.1 (2026-03-16)
-------------------

Bug Fixes (v1.1.1)
------------

- **Per-endpoint rate limit check**: Fixed rate limit check to properly evaluate endpoint-specific rate limits. Previously, the rate limit check was only evaluating global rate limits.

v1.1.0 (2026-03-14)
-------------------

New Features (v1.1.0)
------------

- **Configurable cloud IP refresh interval**: New `cloud_ip_refresh_interval` config field (default: 3600s, valid range: 60-86400s) allows tuning how often cloud provider IP ranges are refreshed. The interval is propagated to Redis TTL for cache consistency.
- **Change detection logging for cloud IP refreshes**: When cloud IP ranges are refreshed, additions and removals are logged per provider (e.g., `+12 added, -3 removed`), providing visibility into IP range mutations.
- **Context-aware detection engine**: Suspicious pattern rules are now tagged with applicable input contexts (`query_param`, `url_path`, `header`, `request_body`). Patterns are only evaluated against relevant input sources, reducing false positives.
- **Structured JSON logging**: New `log_format="json"` config option outputs logs as structured JSON (`{"timestamp": "...", "level": "...", "logger": "...", "message": "..."}`), enabling integration with log aggregation systems (ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch).
- **Per-provider `last_updated` timestamps**: `CloudManager` now tracks when each provider's IP ranges were last refreshed via `cloud_handler.last_updated["AWS"]`, returning `datetime | None`.
